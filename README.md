# Paraglide Alaska

This is my "restaurant" project from The Odin Project curriculum. I decided to divert from the restaurant theme to something a bit more exciting. 

The learning objectives were to:

- Use NPM to install webpack and loaders as development dependencies
- Dynamically render a module tab UI.
- Host the site on GitHub pages from the dist folder.
